# These Weeks in Dev-Tools, issue 4

**2018-05-10**

Welcome to the 4th issue of these weeks in dev-tools! We've re-organised the
teams a little bit and have been working hard towards the 2018 edition release.

These Weeks in Dev-Tools will keep you up to date with all the exciting dev
tools news. We plan to have a new issue every few weeks. If you have any news
you'd like us to report, please comment on the [tracking issue](https://github.com/nrc/dev-tools-team/issues/35).
