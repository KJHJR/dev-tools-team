# Rust dev-tools team

This repo contains resources for the Rust dev-tools team.

The dev-tools team is responsible for developer tools for Rust developers. Dev
tools means any tool a Rust programmer might use when writing, reading, testing,
or running Rust programs. For example, Rust integration with editors or IDEs,
Rustdoc, bindgen, etc.

The dev-tools team does not cover rustc or Cargo, which are large and established
enough to need their own dedicated teams.

For news as it happens, see the [current tools news issue](https://github.com/nrc/dev-tools-team/issues/28).
