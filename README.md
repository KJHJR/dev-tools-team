# Rust dev-tools team

This repo contains resources for the Rust dev-tools team.

The dev-tools team is responsible for developer tools for Rust developers. Dev
tools means any tool a Rust programmer might use when writing, reading, testing,
or running Rust programs. For example, Rust integration with editors or IDEs,
Rustdoc, bindgen, etc. See [our roadmap](roadmaps/README.md) for more details.

Dev-tools is an umbrella team and covers several teams and working groups
dedicated to specific tools. See the [org chart](org-chart.md) for details.
