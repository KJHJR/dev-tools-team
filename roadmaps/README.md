# Roadmaps

Roadmaps let tool maintainers prioritise their work, and advertise to new contributors and the wider community what tasks are high priority.

Tool roadmaps are currently at the 'brainstorming' stage - we're collecting a list of tasks that might be on the roadmap for the rest of the year without prioritising or judging eligibility. As such, you should read these documents with a large grain of salt they'll probably change a lot (or eat your laundry or whatever).

* [Bindgen](TODO)
* [Cargo](TODO)
* [Clippy](TODO)
* [IntelliJ](TODO)
* [The RLS and IDEs](rls.md)
* [Rustdoc](TODO)
* [Rustfmt](rustfmt.md)
* [Rustup](TODO)
* [Racer](TODO)
* [Xargo](TODO)


## General issues/cross-cutting conerns

* Improve contribution to tools
* Improve discoverability/delivery of high quality tools

## Other areas of interest

* Debugging
* Testing/benchmarking
* Rustfix or similar tools (especially in support of epoch migration)
