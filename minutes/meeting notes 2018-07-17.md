## Notes

### Rustfmt and Windows line endings

* https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt/issues/2846
* arguments in both directions
* detection is an option

## tools status

### Clippy
 
* Clippy is on Rustup
* Clippy RFC - still need compiler team input on specific lints and which lints (from candidates) will be added to the compiler

### Others

* RLS and Rustfmt getting close
* cargo fix is now part of cargo
* WASM tooling: work on bindgen, need to ensure CTFs support WASM testing use case
* custom test frameworks are making progress - now support an external version of libtest
