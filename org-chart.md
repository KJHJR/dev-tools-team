# Org chart

The dev-tools team is responsible for overall strategy and vision for Rust dev
tools. It assists the sub-teams with decision making where necessary.

Under dev-tools are several sub-teams. These are long-term, self-sufficient
teams with responsibility for a tool, including decision making on RFCs, etc.
The dev-tool sub-teams are (leader in parens):

* Cargo (aturon)
* IDEs and editors (nrc), including the RLS, Racer and other tools which primarily support IDEs.
* Rustdoc (misdreavus)

Working groups are less formal teams - they might be focused on a single goal
and be time-limited, or might be focused on a tool with a smaller contributor
community. They don't handle RFCs, have a nominated leader, or hold regular
meetings. The dev-tools working groups are:

* Clippy
* testing (focusing on custom test frameworks)
* Doxidize
* Rustfmt
* Rustup
* Bindgen
* debugging
* 2018 edition tools
